# Claude research sessions — standing instructions

Last updated 2026-10-12. Read this first in every new Claude session. It replaces the policy sections of `owner-policy-g-and-v-icons.md` where they differ.

## Roles

- **Claude:** sole researcher. Writes only in `research/claude-drafts/`. Never edits application files, `data/evidence.json`, the coverage audit, Git history or the hosted site.
- **Codex (ChatGPT app):** verifies quotes, integrates, builds, tests, publishes. Its contract is `research/notes/claude-integration-workflow.md` — read it; it defines the record format and the limits every record must keep.
- A full accuracy review by both tools happens when the project is finished. Until then, favour fewer, well-sourced records.

## Owner policy

- Scripture Lens is a **debate tool**.
- **Sources of truth:** Hebrew for the Old Testament, Greek for the New Testament. The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint) is a second ancient witness.
- The **KJV** is the translation compared against those. Do not build findings on ASV wording; ASV may be removed.
- **Tags**
  - **H** — the KJV differs in meaning from the Hebrew.
  - **G** — the Greek differs from the KJV. State "Septuagint" (Old Testament) or "Greek New Testament".
  - **V** — a law, statute or commandment clearly broken and clearly unchecked anywhere in the Bible, by someone under the Law at the time. Pre-Sinai acts and non-Israelites do not qualify. Acts God commands in the story are contradictions, not violations.
  - Untagged records are allowed for direct contradictions that involve no translation or law issue.

## What to propose

Only:

1. Direct wording contrasts between passages, or arithmetic that does not add up.
2. H, G or V cases that meet the tests above.

Do not propose: lists that are not stated to be exclusive, arguments from silence, ethical assessments, poetry read as science, agreement notes, or archaeology and dating without a primary publication you have opened.

## Limits Codex requires in every record

- Different English synonyms are not an H finding unless the meaning differs.
- A shared Hebrew or Greek root does not settle context.
- A digital edition is not proof that every manuscript agrees.
- No rebuke in the passage is not proof of no rebuke anywhere in the Bible — for V, check later books before tagging.

## Sources for original-language text

Fetch with a script, not a summarising web tool, so the wording is exact.

| Text | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hebrew OT, Leningrad (WLC) | `https://bolls.life/get-text/WLC/{book}/{chapter}/` | JSON list of verse and text. Books numbered 1–66 (Joshua 6, Judges 7, Ruth 8, 1 Samuel 9) |
| Hebrew OT, Aleppo edition | same, with `HAC` | Consonants only; second witness |
| Greek OT, Brenton's Septuagint | `https://ebible.org/grcbrent/{CODE}{chapter, two digits}.htm` | e.g. `JDG13`. Has lettered extra verses. English: `https://ebible.org/eng-Brenton/…` |
| Greek NT | bolls.life with `TR`, `SBLGNT`, `TISCH` | Strip the Strong's numbers attached to words |
| KJV as packaged | `data/chapters.json` | gzip + base64 JSON per chapter, key `"{bookIndex from 0}:{chapter}"` (Judges = 6) |

Do not quote from bolls.life `LXX`: it serves dictionary forms, not the wording.

## Deliverables per session

1. `{book}-{chapters}-records.json` — a JSON array of complete records in the `data/evidence.json` schema, plus `tags` and `languageContext`. Copy the shape of the published record `jair-household-count-witness`. Each record's `text` must contain the KJV excerpt, the exact Hebrew or Greek wording, the named edition, and the address it was fetched from. Mark each `"status"` as the intended published value; say in the notes file that all are drafts until Codex accepts them.
2. `{book}-{chapters}-notes.md` — short. For each record: one line on why it qualifies. Then a one-line-each list of what was considered and ruled out, and any question for the owner.

Before writing, check `data/evidence.json` for existing IDs covering the same verses. Extend an existing ID instead of duplicating it.

## Keeping token use down

- One session per book.
- Do not print whole chapters into the conversation; search the packaged text for what you need.
- No open web searching unless a record needs an outside source.
- No long reasoning for rejected items.

## Backlog

Earlier prose drafts in this folder predate the record format. Codex has already adopted some of their findings. Before re-issuing anything from them, check `data/evidence.json` and the latest files in `research/notes/` to see what is published, then convert only what is still outstanding and still qualifies:

- `joshua-21-24-review.md`, `judges-3-5-proposals.md`, `judges-6-9-proposals.md`, `judges-10-12-proposals.md`
- `hebrew-greek-sourcing-1.md` — sourced wording for Joshua 7 to Judges 11 and Acts; the strongest unpublished items are the Balak verb (Joshua 24:9 / Judges 11:25), Genesis 48:22 "Shechem", Acts 7:14 against Genesis 46:27, and the KJV renderings at Judges 3:19, 5:26 and Joshua 22:34.

**Cleared 2026-10-12.** The outstanding items were re-issued as records in `joshua-21-24-records.json` and `judges-3-12-records.json`, with notes beside each. The prose drafts above are superseded; do not re-issue from them. `hebrew-greek-sourcing-1.md` §1.5 is wrong about the Leningrad Codex at Joshua 21:36–37 — see `joshua-21-24-notes.md`. Judges 13–21 is in `judges-13-21-records.json`. Next book: Ruth.

Further sources used: the Unicode/XML Leningrad Codex with transcription notes, `https://tanach.us/Server.txt?Judg18:30-18:30` (book abbreviations `Josh`, `Judg`; a range is required).

## Owner rulings on V (2026-10-12)

1. A same-verb match is **not** enough for V. Gideon's fleece (Judges 6:39 against Deuteronomy 6:16) is not a V case.
2. An act the text never describes is **not** "clearly broken". Jephthah's vow (Judges 11:31, 39) is not a V case.
3. A narrator's general remark **does** count as a "check". Micah's image (Judges 17:3–6) is not a V case because of Judges 17:6.

Apply these to later books: V needs the act described, the law matched by more than a shared verb, and no disapproval from the narrator.

## Open questions for the owner

None.
